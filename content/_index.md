Not simply a static repository, the Nineteenth-Century Data Collective hopes to
increase discoverability for nineteenth-century datasets, share teaching
resources, and most importantly, take data creation seriously as an
intellectual enterprise. Springing from the work of the [Victorian Data Caucus][caucus]
and inspired by the work of [Post45 Data Collective][post45], founding editors Meredith
Martin and Megan Ward aim to shift the conversation toward data work as
interpretive labor. Working with data now, as in the nineteenth century, is
intellectual work in its own right.

Submitting a dataset to the Data Collective does not mean that you cannot
continue to host your data elsewhere, but it does mean that we will make sure
your dataset adheres to the highest standards of metadata and will be more
widely accessible. We particularly encourage inquiries and submissions from
early career researchers and graduate students. Each accepted submission will
receive a DOI to mark it as a peer-reviewed publication. Please review the full
criteria for more information about how we are expanding what data can and
should mean for our field. Please [contact us][contact] if you are interested in serving
as a reviewer or have any questions.

To propose a dataset for inclusion in the collective, please submit a 1000-1500-word curatorial statement—a data essay—organized according to the criteria linked below and addressing these questions as relevant. This statement should make visible the choices and the labor that have gone into the creation of the data set and demonstrate the scholarly value of this data in its field.
