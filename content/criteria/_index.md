This section offers practical steps for preparing the materials needed for publishing a humanities dataset in the C19 Data Collective, which is supported by [Princetonâ€™s Research Data Repository](https://datacommons.princeton.edu/discovery/). This workflow was inspired by a curatorial checklist first created by the Data Curation Network (DCN).[^1]

Many of the steps outlined in this section are meant to be completed throughout the creation of a dataset. However, even when there are intentions to create the documentation for publication during active phases of a project, it is common for some aspects to fall between the cracks. While you may choose to go through the below steps in a linear fashion, you may also identify the areas which need more attention, and skim the other sections. You will find a summary of each section and the deliverables to support the preparation of datasets and related documentation in advance of publication.
