Prepare your dataset by inventorying and reviewing the contents to ensure that you are providing the data in the most useful and sustainable form as possible:

- Review to ensure data files are in a preferred format (ie. non proprietary)
- Create an inventory of the contents of your data files (e.g., data file inventory)
- Describe your naming conventions and ensure they are followed in your folder and file names
- Make sure you have the cleanest data set possible ready for publication.

## File Organization

- File Naming Conventions
- Folder Structure or Hierarchy
- Version Control Strategies

See U Gent’s short (5:42) video, "Knowledge Clip: Keeping research data organized":

## Key Ethical Considerations

- Review any data use agreements and examine potential impacts of sharing this data. Consider:
  - Individuals and communities represented
  - Representativeness of diverse human populations
  - Geographic locations (e.g., contested boundaries, historical and current political situations)
- Is it possible that the dataset may impact a specific group?
  - Use the CARE Principles for Indigenous Data
- Does this dataset comply with any known institutional policies?

## Essential Tasks

### Survey your Data

- Gather working copy of files for formal inventory and publication
- Inventory your dataset
  - Identify file formats (transform to preferred format as needed)
  - Record file organization, hierarchy, and naming convention(s)
  - Extract zip files when possible

### Tidy your Data

- Examine data (and/or code) for obvious errors/missing components, etc.
  - No conflation between missing and blank values
- What is the nature of your data?
  - Original/pure, and needing to be preserved?
  - Crude/nascent, and not valuable until processed?
  - Erroneous/tainted, and problematic if not cleaned?
- What is the dataset trying to do?
  - What's the picture it is providing?
  - What were the steps to get to your destination?
  - What were the blockers and friction points?
- Given your source materials and intentions, what does tidy look like?
  - Good, working order (can people use it to investigate)
  - Durable usability
  - Linked to Taxonomies and/or Controlled Vocabularies (e.g. [Getty Vocabularies](https://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/lod/))

### Strengthen your Data

Examine files, organization, and documentation:

- Are there changes that could enhance the dataset?
  - Are there missing data?
  - Could a user with similar qualifications to the author’s understand and reuse these data and reproduce the results?
  - Are the data, documentation and/or metadata presented in a way that aids in interpretation? (e.g., readme Example)
- Ensure all files are in non-proprietary file formats. Recommended formats:
  - `txt`, `xml`, and `html` for textual data;
  - `csv` for tabular data;
  - `csv` and `xml` for databases;
  - `tiff`, `png`, or `jpg` for images;
  - `mp3`, `wav`, or `flac` for audio files.

## Tasks based on Format

Tasks vary based on file formats and subject domain. Sample tasks based on format:

### Tabular Data (e.g, Microsoft Excel) Questions

- Check the organization of the data–is it well-structured?
- Are headers/codes clearly defined?
- Is quality control clearly defined?
- Is methodology clear and sufficient?

### Database(s) Questions

- Is there documentation on tables, relationships, queries, etc?
- Can the data be exported (to CSV(s), TXT or other) easily?
- Which tables or queries (if any) are used in a publication?

### Code Questions

- Does the provided code execute without errors?
- Is the code commented, i.e., did the author provide descriptive information on sections of code?
- Is data for input missing? Are environmental conditions and parameters noted? Is it clear which language(s) and version(s) are used?
- Does the code use absolute paths or relative paths? If absolute paths, is this documented in the readme?
- Are packages or additional libraries used? If so, is this noted with clear use instructions?
- Are data organized consistently for access by code ?
- Is there an indication of whether the depositor intends reusers to be able to run the code and reproduce results, or just see the process used?

### Data Visualization Questions

- Review alt-text and visualization descriptions. Ensure these describe, but do not interpret, associated visualizations.
- Check data visualizations follow accessible color contrast guidelines
