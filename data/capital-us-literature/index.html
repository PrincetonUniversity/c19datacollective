  <article><h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Literary historians of the United States broadly agree that, at some
point during the nineteenth century, New York City overtakes Boston as
the literary capital of the US. What Pascale Casanova argues Paris is
for world literature, New York becomes for US literature specifically,
and, eventually, Anglophone literatures more generally.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Data recently released by the Library of Congress (LC) allows us to
assess this historical claim in new ways, but not in the format in which
it was originally released. By converting this data to a form useful for
computational literary studies, I have evaluated this geographic shift,
and made it possible for other scholars of nineteenth-century US
literatures to use the same data for a wide range of purposes. Perhaps
more importantly, the code that extracted the data used to answer this
question about nineteenth-century places of publication can be used to
get any fields of interest from any set of the 11 million book catalog
records that the LC has made public.</p>
<p>Nancy Glazener argues that the <em>Atlantic</em> magazine “had greater
authority over American literature than any other institution did” in
the latter half of the nineteenth century.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#2">2</a></sup> Because of this, the
shifting center of US literary culture from Boston to New York City is
sometimes personified in <em>Atlantic</em> editor William Dean Howells. Howells
moved from Ohio to Boston to make his literary mark, and then moved from
Boston to New York in the 1880s.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#3">3</a></sup></p>
<p>Yet the material infrastructures of literary culture involved in such a
shift—the means of production, distribution, and the skilled workers
involved—could not possibly move as easily as did Howells’s prestige.
While <em>The History of the Book in America</em> has already covered many
details of this shift, it does not cover the changing imprint
geographies of US publishing in general and US literary publishing in
particular, in part because this data was neither publicly available nor
in a computationally tractable form.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#4">4</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="lc-marc-distribution-services-books-data">LC MARC Distribution Services books data</h2>
<p>For the first time in 2015 and most recently in 2020, the Library of
Congress (LC) released its open access MARC Distribution Services (MDS)
books dataset to the public, which contains more than 11 million book
records.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#5">5</a></sup> Although these records cannot be said to list every
relevant book, it nevertheless remains the largest such catalog to which
there is public access.</p>
<p><a href="https://c19datacollective.com/data/capital-us-literature/#fig-moby">Figure 1</a> shows how <a href="https://lccn.loc.gov/07017953">one very famous
record</a> among the 11 million appears on
the web.</p>

<p>Below is some of the underlying XML that creates
<a href="https://c19datacollective.com/data/capital-us-literature/#fig-moby">Figure 1</a>, which exemplifies how all of the
records are formatted:</p>

  &lt;subfield code=&quot;c&quot;&gt;1851.&lt;&#x2F;subfield&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;datafield&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>All of these records were created by librarians to describe “monographs
written in nearly all the world’s languages and published anywhere”
including “Cataloging in Publication (CIP) records and minimal level
cataloging records.”<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#6">6</a></sup> My contribution is extracting, cleaning, and
analyzing the data that librarians created in a way that is immediately
useful for scholars of US literature over the long nineteenth century. I
provide both a working model and code for those in any other field who
wish to work with any of the millions of LC MARC records I do not
consider here, and publicize the uses of this resource to address
questions of literary history.</p>
<h2 id="measuring-imprint-geographies">Measuring imprint geographies</h2>
<p>Americanists will be familiar with the “PS” subclass of the LC’s
Language and Literature classification (“P”), which I use to study the
changing imprint geographies of US literature over the long nineteenth
century.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#7">7</a></sup>
Generally, I check every classification value of each of the 11 million
records in the MDS books dataset to see if any of its classifications
are part of the “PS” subclass. I then extract selected fields from the
relevant records. Finally, I clean the values for year and place of
publication to make them computationally tractable. Readers interested
in the details should consult <a href="https://github.com/erikfredner/c19dc">the
repository</a>, which includes code
to reproduce these results locally, and which can be trivially modified
to extract any other records and fields in which they may be
interested.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#8">8</a></sup></p>
<h3 id="findings">Findings</h3>
<p>Given the received narrative from US literary histories, I expected to
see New York’s publishing dominance rise consistently over the century,
reaching a more or less unchallenged position after Reconstruction
begins in 1865. But the data only partially support that narrative.</p>
<figure id="fig-count">
  <img src="lc_ps.png" alt="Figure 2: Five-year rolling average of LC US literature books by place of publication" />
  <figcaption>Figure 2: Five-year rolling average of LC US literature books by place of publication</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><a href="https://c19datacollective.com/data/capital-us-literature/#fig-count">Figure 2</a> shows a five-year rolling average
of the absolute growth in the amount of annual publishing by imprint
city in American literature from 1750 to 1920. Note that this represents
<em>cataloged</em> publications, not sales or any other measure of readership
beyond what is implied by cataloging librarians’ judgment. While it is
quite likely that books printed in New York sold better than books
printed in, say, Indianapolis, this data cannot tell us much about that
disparity.</p>
<figure id="fig-pct">
  <img src="lc_ps_pct.png" alt="Figure 3: Five-year rolling average of the percentage of LC US literature books by place of publication" />
  <figcaption>Figure 3: Five-year rolling average of the percentage of LC US literature books by place of publication</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>However, the absolute growth in publication makes it difficult to see
the changing geographies of US imprints. Measuring proportional change,
as I do in <a href="https://c19datacollective.com/data/capital-us-literature/#fig-pct">Figure 3</a>, suggests that uncertainty
as to whether Boston, Philadelphia, or New York would become the
publishing capital of US literature is over as early as the 1840s, not
in the post-Civil War period as is often assumed.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#9">9</a></sup> In fact, the
period after Reconstruction shows a brief but real <em>decline</em> in New
York’s importance.</p>
<p>More important than revising a timeline, however, is this: The data
suggest that it is never the case that more than half of
nineteenth-century US literature has a New York imprint. Measured in
catalog records, most of US literary publishing happens elsewhere.
Relatedly, the big surprise of these charts is the size of “Other,”
which groups together every place of publication not named in the
legend. Even as Boston and Philadelphia’s shares of US literary
publication decline, Other keeps pace with (and occasionally exceeds)
New York. New York may be the most important single place, but the data
suggest that is far from the only place.</p>
<p>There is much more to be said about these charts elsewhere. For now,
this example shows how one can use the transformed MDS Connect books
data to study questions of historical and critical interest for
nineteenth-century literatures. Other possible applications of the
data—modeling republications, finding the distribution of unique
authors by period, mining the text of the titles, etc.—abound within
the code and data published with this short essay. Other LC record
fields not included like subject headings (e.g., “Ahab, Captain
(Fictitious character)–Fiction. Mentally ill–Fiction.”) could be of
interest. By means of small adjustments to the code in the repository,
anyone interested in other geographies, other periods, or other fields
can extract data from any subset of the LC’s 11 million public records
in a format suitable for analyses like the ones above.</p>
