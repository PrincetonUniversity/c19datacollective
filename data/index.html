      <h2>The Personal library and presumed reading of Algernon Charles Swinburne</h2>
      <h3 class="byline">John Walsh, Alexandra Wingate, Caroline Nurkkala, Alyssa Ollier, Damien Thomas, Jennifer Christie, Evan Brandon</h3>
      <p>
        
          This data publication is a TEI-encoded bibliography (with links to full-text resources) of the personal library and presumed reading of Victorian poet and critic Algernon Charles Swinburne, as brought together in the Algernon Charles Swinburne project. Further details about the project and data are included in the data essay.

      <h2>Moving the Capital of US Literature from Boston to New York: Evidence from 11 million Library of Congress records</h2>
      <h3 class="byline">Erik Fredner</h3>
      <p>
        
          Literary historians of the United States broadly agree that, at some
point during the nineteenth century, New York City overtakes Boston as
the literary capital of the US. What Pascale Casanova argues Paris is
for world literature, New York becomes for US literature specifically,
and, eventually, Anglophone literatures more generally.
Data recently released by the Library of Congress (LC) allows us to
assess this historical claim in new ways, but not in the format in which
it was originally released.

      <h2>Songs of Ourselves: The Circulations and Citations of Nineteenth-Century American Poetry on Twitter</h2>
      <h3 class="byline">Micah Bateman, Caitlin Matheis</h3>
      <p>
        
          Social media has reconditioned the reception, circulation, and uses of literary texts and their authors. Citing Simone Murray and Jessica Pressman, Aarthi Vadde succinctly summarizes that “The Internet has eclipsed television as the determining environment of mass-mediated life…(reshaping) the diffusion of literary practices into paraliterary spheres of textual activity” (456). How social media users engage literature publicly has attracted the attention of a growing group of scholars who also include Susanna Sacks, Tess McNulty, Melanie Walsh, Anna Preus, Edmund G.C. King, Matthew Kilbane, and others. Walsh particularly has been able to leverage quantitative data for critical essays on, for instance, the citations of James Baldwin in #BlackLivesMatter tweets (“Tweets of a Native Son: The Quotation and Circulation of James Baldwin from Black Power to #BlackLivesMatter”). To assist the recent platform turn in literary studies, we’ve assembled a quantitative dataset that charts the number of citations per day by which Twitter (now X) users may refer to nineteenth-century American poets. Using researcher access to Twitter’s full archive, our dataset reveals the frequencies with which strings of text referring to 115 nineteenth-century American poets have been published since Twitter’s launch in 2006. Because Elon Musk’s acquisition of the platform has already resulted in significant data loss from user attrition as well as a foreclosure of researcher access to full-archive data, we view this dataset and others like it from the pre-X era as precious and the need for its preservation, urgent.
