# Nineteenth-Century Data Collective

This is the open-access website for the Nineteenth-Century Data Collective.

## Getting Started

The website is generated by [Zola][zola], a static site generator written in Rust.

### Install Zola

Consult the [official documentation][zola-doc] for the most up-to-date installation instructions. For the impatient, however:

```sh
# macOS
$ brew install zola  # or...
$ sudo port install zola

# Windows
$ scoop install zola  # or...
$ choco install zola

# NixOS / Nixpkgs
$ nix-env -iA nixpkgs.zola
```

Alternatively, download the appropriate Zola binary from [the GitHub release page][zola-release].

### Generate the Site

This will build and serve the site at `127.0.0.1:1111`:

```sh
$ zola serve
```
